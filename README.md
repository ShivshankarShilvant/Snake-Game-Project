# Snake Game

A simple browser-based Snake Game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Responsive grid-based game board, adapting to screen size.
- Keyboard controls for smooth snake movement.
- Score and high score tracking (persistent via localStorage).
- Food spawning, growth mechanic, and collision detection.
- Game timer.
- Game flow modals: start, game over, restart.
- Themed, adaptive UI leveraging CSS custom properties.

## How to Play

1. **Clone this repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/snake-game.git

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
3. **Press "Start Game"** to begin.
4. Control the snake using your keyboard arrows (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`).
5. Eat the food to score points and grow longer.
6. Avoid hitting the walls—the game ends if you do!
